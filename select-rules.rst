How to Select Rules
===================

By default, all rules will be loaded from ``/usr/lib/oclint/rules``, and can be configured and extended by `command line options <command.html>`_.

You can easily drag and drop rules to rule loading paths to select the rules you are going to use for inspections, we call this plug-and-use rule loading mechanism. Check out `rules packaged together with OCLint <rules/index.html>`_.

To add custom rules, please read `how to write your own rules <write-custom-rules.html>`_.
