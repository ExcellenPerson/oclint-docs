Download
========

All release downloads can be found at `OCLint GitHub Releases page`_.

Choosing Pre-Compiled Binaries
------------------------------

Pre-compiled binaries are considered to ease you get started. OCLint binaries depend on very little and fundamental system standard libraries. Therefore, each pre-compiled bundle archive is expected to work on the platform it specifies.

In case the compiled binary doesn't work on this particular environment, consider `building OCLint locally <build.html>`_.

See `installation <installation.html>`_ document for next step when download process is finished.

Choosing Source Code
--------------------

All source code releases contain every module that is required for compilation.

With development codebase, all dependencies are caught up to the latest version; on the contrary, with released codebase, everything is finalized and optimized for that particular version.

Read `how to build OCLint <build.html>`_ when the source code is on hand.
