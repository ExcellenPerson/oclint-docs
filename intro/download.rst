Choosing the Right Version
--------------------------

Development
    OCLint codebase is kept stable by running continuous integrations on various platforms. Thus, it's safe to use the latest development version and get access to new features. However, certain things are under development and may not meet release standard.

Stable
    Latest official release is the most stable version, and meanwhile, is easier to get support from the entire community.

Previous
    Previous release is the second latest stable version, it's still supported by the community. But it will be archived when next version releases.

Unsupported
    Choosing archived versions without supports.

This documentation is updated for OCLint version |release|.

Choosing Pre-Compiled Binaries
------------------------------

Pre-compiled binaries are considered to ease you get started. OCLint binaries depend on very little and fundamental system standard libraries. Therefore, each pre-compiled bundle archive is expected to work on the platform it specifies.

In case the compiled binary doesn't work on this particular environment, consider `building OCLint locally <build.html>`_.

See `installation <installation.html>`_ document for next step when download process is finished.

Choosing Source Code
--------------------

All source code releases contain every module that is required for compilation.

With development codebase, all dependencies are caught up to the latest version; on the contrary, with released codebase, everything is finalized and optimized for that particular version.

Read `how to build OCLint <build.html>`_ when the source code is on hand.
