Writing Your Own Rules
======================

It's cool to add new capability to OCLint by writing your own rules, instead of waiting for us get around to implementing them. You are more welcome to share your rules with the entire community.

.. note:: It might be easier to get started with looking at current rules.

Your rule must implement ``RuleBase`` class or its derived abstract classes.
