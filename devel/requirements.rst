System Requirements
===================

OCLint can be compiled on all unix-like systems, theoretically. Latest Mac OS X, FreeBSD, and major Linux distributions are tested and recommended.

LLVM System Requirements
------------------------

OCLint is based on `libTooling`_ for parsing source code and generating `Abstract Syntax Tree`_ (AST) generation. Prior to compiling OCLint, we need to compile LLVM/Clang. Check out `LLVM System Requirements`_ for requirements. These requirements are very fundamental development tools that probably you already have them.

OCLint System Requirements
--------------------------

Some tools are emphasized here, you may want to double check and make sure the toolkit is ready when you need it.

#. `Apache Subversion`_
#. `Git`_
#. `CMake`_
#. `LTP GCOV Extension`_ (lcov)

Extra Notes
-----------

Notes for Mac OS X
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

`Homebrew`_ is highly recommended for Mac OS X users. When we have ``homebrew`` installed, we can simply get all the dependencies by

.. code-block:: bash

    brew install subversion git cmake lcov

Notes for Ubuntu
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

All Ubuntu users should be able to get all the dependencies by ``apt-get``, for example:

.. code-block:: bash

    apt-get install subversion git cmake lcov

We have noticed the coverage meta data generated by clang is not compatible with the latest version of gcov, but a gcov 4.2, 4.3 and 4.4 versions should work. In order to get the code coverage report, downgrading entire gcc tool set is recommended. Ubuntu provides a handy method to keep multiple versions in the system and easy to switch among them by ``update-alternatives``, for example:

.. code-block:: bash

    apt-get install g++-4.4
    update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/gcov gcov /usr/bin/gcov-4.6 10
    update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/gcov gcov /usr/bin/gcov-4.4 20
    update-alternatives --config gcov # and choose version 4.4
    # you can also use the same method to switch your gcc and g++ compiler, but it's optional

Notes for Fedora
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We should be able to get all the dependencies by ``yum``, for example:

.. code-block:: bash

    yum install gcc-c++ make git subversion cmake lcov

Notes for FreeBSD
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The dependencies can be found in the follow ports folders:

* ``/usr/ports/devel/subversion16``  # LLVM codebase is not compatible with 1.7 version yet
* ``/usr/ports/devel/git``
* ``/usr/ports/devel/cmake``
* ``/usr/ports/devel/lcov``

Simply go through each folder, and install them by

.. code-block:: bash

    make install clean
